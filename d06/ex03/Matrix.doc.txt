<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class defines a matrix according to the following parameters:

The class constructor expects an array. Expected keys are the following:

'Preset': type of matrix to build, mandatory. The value must be one of
previous class constants.

'Scale': the scale factor, when compulsory 'preset' is SCALE.

'Angle': rotation angle in radians, when compulsory 'preset' is RX, RY or RZ.

'Hybrid': translation vector, mandatory when 'preset' is TRANSLATION.

'FOV' Vision of the projection fields in degrees, when compulsory 'preset' 
PROJECTION worth.

'Ratio': ratio of the projected image, when required 'preset' is PROJECTION.

'Near': near clipping plane of the projection, when compulsory 'preset' is
PROJECTION.

'Far': far clipping plane of the projection, when compulsory 'preset' is
PROJECTION.

It puts at disposal the following methods:

Mult Matrix (Matrix $ rhs) returns a new matrix multiplication résulat
the two matrices.

Vertex transformVertex (Vertex $ vtx) returns a new vertex result
processing of the vertex by the matrix.
